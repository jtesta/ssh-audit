Below are notes for creating a Windows executable.

An executable can only be made on a Windows host because the PyInstaller tool (https://www.pyinstaller.org/) does not support cross-compilation.

On a Windows machine, do the following:

1.) Install Python v3.7.x from https://www.python.org/.  (As of this writing v3.8.0 isn't supported.)  To make life easier, check the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

2.) Using pip, install pyinstaller and colorama:

    pip install pyinstaller colorama

3.) Create the executable with:

    pyinstaller -F --icon packages\windows_icon.ico ssh-audit.py

4.) The 'dist' folder will have the resulting ssh-audit.exe.
